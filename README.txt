GoToo is a web application for finding events in your area built for an independent study in Spring 2014. It was concieved when we saw a gap in the marketplace for event curation, especially on Facebook. Every week, Facebook users received event notifications that were irrelevant to them and in a different location. Using PHP, Javascript, HTML5, and CSS3, GoToo was built as a prototype prior to building a native iOS application.
